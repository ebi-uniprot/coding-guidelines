# Sprint release procedure for [uniprot-website](https://github.com/ebi-uniprot/uniprot-website)
On the main branch perform the following:
1. [Update and release Franklin](franklin_release.md)

3. Update the coverage ([see below](#coverage-bump))
4. Push the updated `main` to remote: `git push origin main`
5. Tag a release, adding the list of implemented features and bug fixes (compiled in sprint review doc) ([see below](#tag-a-new-release))
6. Tell everyone it's ready üéâ
7. Delete stale branches upon confirmation from the team üßπ

## Details

### Upgrade UniProt's package dependencies
Note: do [the same process on Franklin](https://github.com/ebi-uniprot/coding-guidelines/blob/main/franklin_release.md#upgrade-franklins-package-dependencies) first as UniProt depends on Franklin. It will allow us to have the same up-to-date version of common dependencies at the same time.

It is assumed you're on UniProt's main and have all branches for that sprint merged in (if ready). Select all compatible upgrades and test:
```
yarn upgrade-interactive --latest
<select compatible upgrades>
yarn test
```
Now upgrade one-by-one the packages with breaking upgrades:
```
yarn upgrade-interactive --latest
<select an upgrade>
yarn test
```

### Coverage bump
Bump the test coverage as to define a new reference for the new sprint:
```
yarn coverage-bump
```

### Tag a new release
Tag the release with the relevant release notes https://github.com/ebi-uniprot/uniprot-website/releases
- To tag on your local machine: `git tag -a v<version> -m "v<version>"` eg `git tag -a v0.18-alpha -m "v0.18-alpha"`
- To push (annotated) tags: `git push --follow-tags origin main`
- Draft a new release
- Put the sprint goal as release title
- Write the list of new features/bug fixes (already compiled in sprint review document)

### Delete stale branches
Check in github if there any stale branches within both uniprot and franklin and if so, inform the team via slack that you will delete them unless anybody has objections. If all OK, delete the branches.
