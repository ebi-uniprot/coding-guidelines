# Sprint release procedure
## on `uniprot-website`
1. Merge current sprint goal branch into master
2. Tag a release on master, adding list of implemented features and bug fixes (compiled in sprint review doc)
3. Update dependencies - if breaking change and requires too much effort, create a Jira instead
4. Create a new sprint goal branch, following the `YYYY_sprintnumber` pattern
