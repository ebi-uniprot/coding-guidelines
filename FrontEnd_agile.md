# Agile for front-end team

## Sprint review responsibilities
Every sprint, a different team member is responsible for the sprint review.

### Before and during the demo
- collect and compile the list of completed tasks, towards the sprint goal, in a google doc. (this should be done or delegated by the PO a few days before the end of sprint)
- prepare a short demo, or set of short demos to highlight the work achieved.
- describe any ongoing work and explain why it wasn't done, highlighting any blockers.

### After the demo
 - merge goal branch into master (if agreed by the PO) and create the new sprint goal branch (see https://github.com/ebi-uniprot/coding-guidelines/blob/master/Version_control.md#sprint-goal-branch)
 - on the new sprint goal branch, update all dependencies, communicating with the rest of the team any braking changes while upgrading (to be put in backlog, or solved during new sprint)
